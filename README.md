# Idea Weaver

**Let your local AI be your creative muse.**

Idea Weaver is a multi-agentic application designed to be your creative partner. It leverages a team of specialized AI agents, powered by local Large Language Models (LLMs) via **Ollama**, to transform a simple story premise into a well-structured narrative concept. The entire creative process is orchestrated by **CrewAI** and is fully observable through **LangSmith**, giving you a transparent look into the AI's reasoning process.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration Flow

The application employs a sequential pipeline where each agent builds upon the work of the previous one, creating a comprehensive story scaffold. This structured collaboration ensures that all aspects of the story concept are coherent and well-developed.

## What is Idea Weaver?

This application does not write a complete, finished story. Instead, it acts as a **creative partner** to rapidly develop a detailed **story concept or scaffold** from a simple idea.

Think of it as an automated, high-speed brainstorming session with a team of creative specialists. Its main goal is to take you from a single spark of an idea (e.g., "a hobbit and a wizard on a journey") to a structured, well-defined plan that you, the writer, can then use to write the actual story.

### The Process

1.  **The User's Initial Idea:** The process starts with you providing a basic premise, a target audience, and a title. You also choose whether to have character names generated by the AI or to enter them yourself.
2.  **The Assembly of the AI "Crew":** The application assembles a team of four specialized AI agents.
3.  **The Collaborative Brainstorming Process:**
    *   **World Builder:** Expands the premise into a rich world.
    *   **Character Creator:** Creates compelling characters for that world in a human-readable format.
    *   **Narrative Nudger:** Introduces a plot twist.
    *   **Summary Writer:** Synthesizes everything into a short summary.
4.  **The Final Output:** The application compiles all the outputs into a single Markdown file, which serves as your story blueprint.
